Fake faces generated by DCGANs with the CelebA dataset. The left is the example of original faces from the CelebA dataset. The right is the fake faces generated by the DCGANs after 300 epochs of training.
## Training and Results
To train the DCGANs and evaluate its performance, I first trained the model with MNIST dataset, which is a simple handwriting digits dataset, to see how the DCGANs work with simple small dataset. After that, I modified the model and trained it again with the CelebA datasets, which is a large-scale human faces dataset with over 200k images of human faces.
### MNIST
I first trained the model with MNIST dataset for 200 epochs, which costs about 9 minutes in HiperGator with one GPU requesting 4GB Memery. Figure 4 is the results of the training using MNIST dataset.

As we can see, the DCGANs perform pretty well on this small simple dataset. The results after 100 epochs are already recognizable, and whole training process is completed very quickly.
### CelebA
After testing the DCGANs with MNIST dataset, I modified and optimized the model to make it work properly with the CelebA dataset. I trained the model in HiperGator for 300 epochs, which cost more than 13 hours to finish.

For the results presented above, we can see that the shape of human faces appears after 50 epochs of training, and more details of face become recognizable after 200 epochs, such as teeth, hair and facial expressions.

## How to run the code
To run the code, you need to put the dataset folder in the same path as the python files.
In the folder “face_new_training_checkpoints”, there is a saved model which have been trained for 300 epochs.
1. Open the terminal and go to the path of the python file.
2. To train the model, type “python3 dcgan_face_new.py”
3. To generate random faces, type “python3 randomface.py”
4. To calculate the FID score, type “python3 eval.py”
